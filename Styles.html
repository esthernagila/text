<h2>Short story all about me for now :)</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is a new website concerning everyone.I'll start</p>
<p>I'm Esther but commonly referred to as Essy.</p>
<p>I am an aspiring and in the making <b>software engineer.</b></p>
<p>I can proudly say that Iam familiar with some coding languages such as html and css.</p>
<p>I appreciate art and mostly ones connected with the moon as the ones below:</p>

<br>
<p>In a short span of time I have learnt how to style websites as magnificent as the one your eyes feast upon</p>
<p>My favourite phenomenons are the deserts and storms crazy as it sounds, but mostly deserts because they are orangish in colour</p>
